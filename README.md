Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into new areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

Each problem is designed to be solved with a computer program, and the solutions are required to be submitted via the Project Euler website. The problems range in difficulty and cover a wide range of topics including number theory, cryptography, probability, and optimization.

Project Euler has over 800 problems, and new ones are added regularly. The website keeps track of the progress of each user, and provides a ranking system based on the number of problems solved.

Whether you are a seasoned programmer or just starting out, Project Euler provides a great opportunity to challenge yourself and improve your problem-solving skills. So dive in, and happy problem-solving!
