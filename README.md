## What is the Euler Project?

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
The problems range in difficulty and cover a wide range of topics including number theory, cryptography, probability, and optimization.
